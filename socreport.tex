\begin{abstract}
In this report, we study a problem and design an efficient algorithm
to solve the problem.  We implemented the algorithm and evaluated
its performance againts previous proposed algorithms that solves the
same problem.  Our results show that our algorithm runs faster.

\chapter{Introduction}
Many problems exist in computer science.  In this project, we 
studied one particular important problem and propose a solution 
for it.  

\section{Background}
In this section, we briefly discuss the history and background
of the problem.  A detail literature survey is presented in 
Chapter \ref{ch:related}.

The problem we study in this report is an important one.
This problem is first proposed in 1990 in the context
of graph theory \cite{smith90graph}.  Zhang gives the
first algorithm to the problem and applied it to solve several 
problems in artificial intelligence \cite{zhang91ai,zhang92ai}.  
More recently, a slightly different formulation of the problem
is studied independently \cite{kovsky92diff,ali94diff}.  None of this previous work
uses the technique that we propose in this project.  Thus, we 
believe that our algorithm is novel.

\section{The Problem}
In this section, we formally defined the problem.  We adopt
the definition given by Kovsky \cite{kovsky92diff}.

\chapter{Proofs}
In this appendix, we present alternate, longer, but more interesting proof 
of correctness of our algorithm.  This proof is based on induction and proof
by contradiction.
